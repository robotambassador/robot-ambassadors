    The idea here is that there may be several nodes on the ground station PC that are interested in the
    onboard data, and we don't want that data to be sent over the wireless multiple times as a result.
    
    This is accomplished by running relay nodes. Unfortunately we need to run one for every single topic that
    we want relayed. Ideally we'd rather use something like the proxy node from umd-ros-pkg, however currently there
    is a bug (https://bugs.launchpad.net/umd-ros-pkg/+bug/669782) that prevents this from working. But at least the
    extra processes are being added on the ground PC, not on the flyer.
    
    Thus, nodes running on the ground station PC should subscribe to downlink/<topic> rather than just <topic>.
