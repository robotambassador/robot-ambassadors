\b eros_msg_latency is benchmarks the tcp/ip messaging system.... 

\section Overview

This package includes three separate tests benchmarking the speed of msg passing in various 
contexts.

- Passing a copy of float64 between two processes.
- Passing a copy of float64 between two threads.
- Passing a pointer to a float64 between two threads.

all of course, via topics.

\subsection InterProcessCopy

@code
./talker
./listener
@endcode

It will output latencies and finally when terminated (ctrl-c) will output the average
latency to standard output.

\subsection InterThreadCopy

@code
./thread_passing_copies
@endcode

\subsection InterThreadPointers

@code
./thread_passing_pointers
@endcode

Note this one is almost functionally identical to the previous one - you just pass a boost
shared pointer when publishing instead of an actual object.

\section Results

Passing inter-thread with pointers is \b fast. There is no tcp/ip layer and no copying. 
Also, you may find on very low spec boards, the latencies drastically increase - there are many
polling loops in the ros and this seems to play havoc with the msg passing latencies. Also make sure
you have everything optimised (release modes) and the floating point settings correctly set.
