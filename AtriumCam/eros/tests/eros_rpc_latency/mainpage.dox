\b eros_rpc_latency benchmarks the rpc messaging system. 

\section Overview

This package includes two separate tests. Both tests effectively timestamp an rpc service message, sends
to a server, which again timestamps the respons and sends it back. Upon receipt, latencies are calculated.
The only difference between the two tests are the storage type - either integers or floats. This is 
important as on some embedded boards, float types can have some problems and also show a marked slowdown
depending on whether it is software emulated or not.

\subsection Integral

@code
roscd eros_rpc_latency/bin
./server
./client // in a separate terminal
@endcode

Latencies will be printed every second, and upon termination of the client (ctrl-c), the average
latency will be printed to standard output.

\subsection Float

@code
roscd eros_rpc_latency/bin
./float_server
./float_client // in a separate terminal
@endcode
