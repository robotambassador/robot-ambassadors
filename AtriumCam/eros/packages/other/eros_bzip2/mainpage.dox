\section packageSummary Package Summary

	This provides a source package for (cross) compiling bzip2 (needed by boost).
	
	Ordinarily this is not useful as you would install via your system's
	installation method (e.g. apt-get for ubuntu), but for cross-compiling 
    it provides the recipe needed to make a toolchain ros-ready.

\section ChangeLog

	- <b>Oct 10</b> : Done and road tested.
