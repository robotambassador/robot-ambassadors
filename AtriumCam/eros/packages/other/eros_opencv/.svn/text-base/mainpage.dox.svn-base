\section Overview

Ros' package for opencv basically builds the whole kitchen sink. We don't
want most of it on an embedded board. So we turn off alot of flags. Currently
this pulls the latest bugfix release from opencv's svn 2.1 tag.

\section maintenance Maintenance

This package will have to be revalidated every time ros updates the opencv - we
should always try and sync our opencv package with theirs.

\section Usage

This package can either be used within the ros tree (appropriate exports are 
configured) or or installed in a sysroot ('make install') which is useful for 
traditional embedded development with a partial cross.

\section Contents

Opencv is compiled with all options turned off except JPEG and PNG. To modify the build,
simply edit the appropriate section in the cmake/OpenCvBuild.cmake file.
