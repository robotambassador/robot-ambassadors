\section packageSummary Package Summary

	This provides a source package for compiling the apache runtime utilities.
	Ordinarily this is not useful as you would install via your system's
	installation method (e.g. apt-get for ubuntu), but for cross-compiling 
    it provides the recipe needed to make a toolchain ros-ready.

\section potIssues Potential Issues
  
    - Downloads from one of korea's apache mirrors. Not sure how to get it to automatically find a good mirror yet.
    - Might need a check to properly evaluate ac_cv_sizeof_struct_iovec
    
\section ChangeLog

	- <b>Oct 10</b> : Done and road tested.
