\section packageSummary Package Summary

	This provides a source package for (cross) compiling a minimal boost ideally
	targeted at embedded systems.
	
	Ordinarily this is not useful as you would install via your system's
	installation method (e.g. apt-get for ubuntu), but for cross-compiling 
    it provides the recipe needed to make a toolchain ros-ready.

\section Notes

	Currently the list of packages selected for install is very minimal and sufficient
	for compiling a minimal set of packages inside ros for a working system. If more 
	packages wish to be added to the set, we can add these later (with some testing as
	some make cross-compiling complicated).

\section potIssues Potential Issues

    - Might need to check ros versions and install the boost to match the ros version 
      - Refer to the ros rep for more information (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0003.html).

\section ChangeLog

	- <b>Oct 10</b> : Done and road tested.
