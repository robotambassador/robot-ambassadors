  <description brief="Simple implementation of roscpp">
    roscpplight is a simple implementation of a part of the ROS communication layer, allowing a component to publish and subscribe to ROS messages.
    The purpose is to provide a library for interfacing simple nodes e.g. sensors, actuators or other robot control systems to ROS with a minimum set of dependencies and threading model constraints.
    The current version is a test of the concept and thus not meant for serious use.
    It uses boost asio for network communication to improve portability.
    XmlRpc++ has been used for convenience, but a different xmlrpc implementation would improve the threading constraints.
