====================== Roscpp ======================

== Against ==

Files: lots
Ticket: https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3424
Ticket Status: pending
Revision: 13526.

== Summary ==

Note, couldn't use service robotics socket stuff because the WSA calls only exist
in windows vista onwards. Instead, using some old player code but probably needs an update.

== Issue Tracking ==

- init.cpp
  - https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/ticket/3319 : moving the time init function.
  
== Eros ==

It also overlays across patches from eros in diamondback to slow down timers (see
the diffs there for details).

== Mingw ==

Lots of minor stuff from jeff and service robotics, kinda mixed in and bugfixed to work.
  - Couldn't use alot of service robotic's code, it was vista++
  - Built our own poll function, largely similar to ssh's poll.

== Other ==

  - roslib::Clock -> rosgraph_msgs::Clock
  - manifest removed roslib dependency, added boost filesystem, system dependencies.
  - in init.cpp, ros::shutdown() aborts if !initialized (otherwise global queue ptr throws).

== Todo ==

Jeff's and service robotic's ports both used the following code to decode 
chars for msvc. Mingw didn't seem to need this, but we may need to introduce it later. 

<code file_log.cpp>
#ifdef WIN32
	LOG4CXX_DECODE_CHAR(temp01, std::string("[%c] [%d] [thread %t]: [%p] %m\n"));
	log4cxx::LayoutPtr layout = new log4cxx::PatternLayout(temp01);
	LOG4CXX_DECODE_CHAR(temp02, log_file_name);
	log4cxx::RollingFileAppenderPtr appender = new log4cxx::RollingFileAppender(layout, temp02, false);
#else
<endcode>

Might also be a better way to do a poll, see my email from josh faust.
    
===== Features =====

- Cross platform organisation of headers, macros, typedefs [io.h/io.cpp] 
- Cross platform abstractions for low level functions (close_socket, last_socket_error, poll, signal_pair) [io.h/io.cpp]
- Disable some signal functionality (check this!) [common.cpp, init.cpp]
- Move Time::init() to a good place [init.cpp]
- Utilise the cross platform socket_poll and signal_pair [poll_set.cpp]
- Undef ERROR to avoid a bug caused by windows macro pollution [rosout_appender.cpp]
- Utilise cross platform abstractions, also win32 send/recv socket code [transport_tcp/udp.cpp]
