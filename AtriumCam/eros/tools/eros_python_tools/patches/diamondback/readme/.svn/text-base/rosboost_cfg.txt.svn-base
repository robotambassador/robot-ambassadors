Revision: 12977
Ticket: -
Modification:
    Fixes the ROS_BOOST_ROOT priority and also allows it to 
    automatically find and classify system directories in the
    toolchain root when a toolchain root is used (no more need
    for ROS_BOOST_ROOT when cross compiling). Note, this won't be
    ticketed as rosboost-cfg will phase out on rosbuild2.
