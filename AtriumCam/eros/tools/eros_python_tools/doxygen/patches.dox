/**
@page patchesGuide Patches

@section Overview

Whenever we have patches to be applied to the ros or ros' packages
these will be committed upstream as soon as possible. While waiting
for the fix to filter through however, eros will maintain the patches
so that cross-compiling is as bug-free as possible.

The patches will always gracefully default to normal behaviour if
not cross-compiling.

@section Applying

The patches will be automatically applied to your version of ros
whenever you run rostoolchain. It's all automatic and everything
happens in the background....so nothing to see here!

@section moreInfo More Information on the Patches

If you wish to know more about the individual patches, refer to the 
appropriate folder in eros_python_tools/patches. Each patch
has an associated readme.txt which provides some brief information
about the patch and a url to any tickets that have been submitted
upstream.
