@section Overview

Eros toolchains is a library of preconfigured cmake toolchain modules
for popular/standard toolchain configurations on various platforms.

\section Arrangement

The library of cmake modules is grouped firstly according to platform
(aka family) and then by name (usually the toolchain tuple). 

\section Anatomy
 
Each toolchain provides the necessary cmake variables for discovering
your compiler, libs and headers. Some notes:

- Make sure the cross-compiler is in your PATH
- By default, it will utilise only the sysroot's libs and headers. 
- Some extra variables are set for convenience that merely uniquely identify the toolchain

@code
TOOLCHAIN_FAMILY : the platform/group the toolchain belongs to (e.g. crossdev||ubuntu etc).
TOOLCHAIN_TUPLE : signature identifying cpu-vendor-platform-clib.
TOOLCHAIN_SYSROOT : root of the target development environment (libraries, headers etc).
@endcode

To check in detail what's been configured, track down the toolchain in the
eros_toolchains package or your ros home (i.e. /home/<username>/.ros/toolchains) and
check out the contents. If it is the currently set toolchain, you can
edit $ROS_ROOT/rostoolchain.cmake for minor (temporary) modifications.
