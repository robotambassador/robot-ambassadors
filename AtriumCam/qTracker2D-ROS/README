This folder contains all the files needed to run the QT 2D Tracker.
The system needs to have the following in order to compile and run the code.
   - Qt (Tested only on version 4.6.2) 
   - OpenCV (Tested only on version 2.0)
   - Phonon module (It is needed to play the cricket calling song. Otherwise, comment out anything related to Phonon)

By running the qTracker2D.pro with QT creator the project opens and can be then built.


Running qTracker2D

The initial dialog box asks for the camera settings. Usually the camera is the 0 (zero) or if more camera's are connected try other like 1,2 or 3.
For linux the default resolution, that cannot be changed, is 640x480. 

In order to start tracking you need to fill the tracker settings, first. 
Then, when the tracking starts, you need to click on the object to select its template for the tracking.
By pressing the keys 1-6, you can reselect the template of the corresponding object.
